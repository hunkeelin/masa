# Screen Capture Exclusion Test Project

This project demonstrates window layer manipulation techniques using Electron to create overlay windows that attempt to avoid screen capture detection.

## Key Technologies
- **Electron**: For cross-platform desktop application development
- **Native Window APIs**: For window layer manipulation and screen capture exclusion
- **Platform-specific flags**: macOS and Windows optimizations

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on window manipulation and overlay techniques
- Test screen capture exclusion across different platforms
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Use Electron's native window options for transparency and layering

## Testing Priorities
- Screen sharing compatibility with various platforms (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.)
- Window positioning and drag functionality
- Platform-specific exclusion effectiveness
